# AmpYear
A KSP plugin that increase the importance and usefulness of electricity and adds ION RCS.
Fork of original AmpYear by SodiumEyes until he returns or gives permission to take over the Mod. 
Still includes ION RCS part.

Changes from Original Version include: Removed original AmpYear Part - no longer requires special part to function. 
Instead you just need a command pod or probe core. This of course also removes the original AmpYear ASAS,
not really required any more as ASAS modules available in stock. (see further comments below). 
Removed the 'copied' RemoteTech flight computer. If you want a flight computer install RemoteTech. 
Removed obsolete functions around SAS and ASAS electrical usage. 
Amended the PowerTurn function :- Powerturn function remains whilst ASAS was removed. 
Base SAS as per .90 is supported. Powerturn provides additional ability to use Electrical Power to Power-Assist ReactionWheels 
and SAS (both seperate parts and where the modules are used in Pods and Probes). - Need to complete testing on this function. 
Added ModuleManager dependency to add ReservePower to command pods and probe cores. 
Added Toolbar dependency and Icon. 
Added Config Settings to SpaceCentre to change Heater, Cooling and Massage settings. 
Corrected calculations for Electricity Consumption and Generation and GUI improvements. 
In Editor (VAB) you can see Power Production and Consumption parts and totals. - Still somewhat BUGGED. 
Includes power calculations if you have the following Mods installed (but not required for mod to function): 
Near Future Electrical KAS RemoteTech KAS ScanSat Telemachus TAC LS AntennaRange BTSM

Planned/Ideas: 
Complete testing and bug fixes - Known - check for window position off screen. 
Revision/fix Saving Settings states for vessels. - Currently does not save vessel states correctly. 
Revision of Luxury components. 
Expand configurability settings. 
Fix GUI for in Editor calculations of power generation and consumption. 
Improve subsystems integration/list? 
Include calcs for Interstellar, Near Future Solar, Karbonite mods, AviationLights, Infernal robotics. 
Integrate to stock icon bar?
